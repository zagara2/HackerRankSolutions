# Hacker Rank Solutions

## What is this?

From Wikipedia: "HackerRank is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications."

You can find my HackerRank profile at https://www.hackerrank.com/zagara . 

These are the solutions to several HackerRank challenges, of varying difficulty, that I solved for fun in my spare time. I went in order through the site's Python challenge track (and still have yet to complete all the Python challenges, as there are quite a few). All of the code in this repo passed every test case and recieved the maximum possible number of points. 

Each folder contains a text file linking to the prompt for that specific challenge, as well as a .py file containing the code used to solve the challenge. 

I had to migrate all of the code from HackerRank's site to this repo, because unfortunately, HackerRank does not have an option to make my solution code visible to the public.
